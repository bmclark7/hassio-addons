## About

You can use this add-on to install Eclipse Mosquitto, which is an open-source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker that implements the MQTT protocol. Mosquitto is lightweight and is suitable for use on all devices from low power single board computers to full servers. For more information, please see [mosquitto].

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Hass.io** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Find the "Mosquitto broker" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

The add-on has a couple of options available. To get the add-on running:

1. Start the add-on.
2. Have some patience and wait a couple of minutes.
3. Check the add-on log output to see the result.

Create a new user for MQTT via the **Configuration** -> **Users (manage users)**.
Note: This name cannot be `homeassistant` or `addon`, those are reserved usernames.

To use the Mosquitto as a broker, go to the integration page and install the configuration with one click:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Configuration** -> **Integrations**.
2. Use the Add button and search for MQTT
3. Configure the Broker, Port, Username, Password and Submit.

If you have old MQTT settings available, remove this old integration and restart Home Assistant to see the new one.

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "logins": [],
  "anonymous": false,
  "customize": {
    "active": false,
    "folder": "mosquitto"
  },
  "certfile": "fullchain.pem",
  "keyfile": "privkey.pem",
  "require_certificate": false
}
```

### Option: `logins` (optional)

A list of local users that will be created with username and password. You donâ€™t need to do this because you can use Home Assistant users too, without any configuration.

### Option: `anonymous`

Allow anonymous connections. If logins are set, the anonymous user can only read data.

Default value: `false`

#### Option: `customize.active`

If set to `true` additional configuration files will be read, see the next option.

Default value: `false`

#### Option: `customize.folder`

The folder to read the additional configuration files (`*.conf`) from.

### Option: `cafile` (optional)

A file containing a root certificate.

### Option: `certfile`

A file containing a certificate, including its chain.

### Option: `keyfile`

A file containing the private key.

### Option: `require_certificate`

If set to `true` encryption will be enabled using the cert- and keyfile options.

## Home Assistant user management

This add-on is attached to the Home Assistant user system, so MQTT clients can make use of these credentials. Local users may also still be set independently within the configuration options for the add-on. For the internal Hass.io ecosystem, we register `homeassistant` and `addons`, so these may not be used as user names.

## Disable listening on insecure (1883) ports

Remove the ports from the add-on page network card (set them as blank) to disable them.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

It is possible to restrict access to topics based upon the user logged in to Mosquitto. In this scenario, it is recommended to create individual users for each of your clients and create an appropriate ACL.

See the following links for more information:

- [Mosquitto topic restrictions](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/topic-restriction-mosquitto-configuration/)
- [Mosquitto.conf man page](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-conf-5.html)

Add the following configuration to enable **unrestricted** access to all topics.

1. Enable the customize flag

    ```json
      "customize": {
        "active": true,
        "folder": "mosquitto"
      },
    ```

2. Create `/share/mosquitto/acl.conf` with the contents:

    ```text
    acl_file /share/mosquitto/accesscontrollist
    ```

3. Create `/share/mosquitto/accesscontrollist` with the contents:

    ```text
    user [YOUR_MQTT_USER]
    topic readwrite #
    ```

The `/share` folder can be accessed via SMB, or on the host filesystem under `/usr/share/hassio/share`.

## Known issues and limitations

- Since version 4.1 of the add-on, an explicit ACL definition is now required if you plan to use legacy logins and `"anonymous": true` [see these instructions](#access-control-lists-acls).
